1. Code deduplication (Turn passing, Dice rolling)
2. Separation of concerns (Player attributes and question management => Player class, QuestionProvider class)
3. Win condition is irrelevant (inversed)
4. Bad naming and factoring (wasCorrectlyAnswered, wrongAnswered ==> merged)
5. Nested conditions & complex combinations, not human friendly neither functional oriented code
